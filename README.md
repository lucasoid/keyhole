# Keyhole
## An implementation of Doctrine DBAL designed to simplify user-managed database tables

### What do we have here?

Keyhole is an interface to allow users to create database tables and entries. What you, and they, do with that is TBD.

* Build a registry of tables and columns.
* Define access rules.
* Dynamically create or update tables that have been registered.
* Save, delete, and retrieve data from the created tables.

### Install:
```composer require lucasoid/keyhole```

### Get started:
See https://github.com/lucasoid/keyhole-demo-php for a sample implementation.
